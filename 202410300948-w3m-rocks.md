## home

Site dedicated to the finer aspects of W3M, an open-source terminal web browser
(and pager) available for any Unix-like OS.

While traditionally considered a 'backup' recourse for browsing simple pages in
a non-graphical environment, I use it as a primary browser on all workstations
(Linux laptops and Android Tablets inside Termux).

A handful of key features

  * All HTML entities rendered via ASCII and Unicode
  * No JavaScript
  * No CSS; just basic HTML 4.0 rendering, including tables
  * No images (without terminal hacks). Images viewable externally via
    keystroke.
  * Uniform, basic 8-color palette.
  * Supports buffers and tabs for switching between loaded pages.
  * Interact entirely via customizable keystrokes or even macros (also has
    mouse support)
  * Integrate seamlessly with your terminal editor (ie VIM/Emacs)
  * Navigation/scrolling/searching nearly instantaneous across loaded content.
    No visual delay inherent to graphical browsers.
  * Place and easily navigate across marks within a page
  * Handy as an E-Reader

Merits

View content without modern web bloat

  * No pop-up ads (no JavaScript to render them)
  * No distracting images (without hacks in certain terminals)
  * Emulate the traditional, minimalist web.
  * Reclaim emotional energy and time.
  * Emphasize the actual, pertinent web content

Conserve eyesight

  * No overwhelming styles or colors (or ads or flashy pop-ups)
  * One configurable color scheme for all pages (ie light text on a dark
    background), without external plugins or site customizations

Extremely lightweight

  * No CPU or GPU stress for graphical rendering or JavaScript calls
  * Tiny memory footprint dedicated predominantly to text.
  * Lighter network traffic. Again, only text content to deal with.

Prevails over any graphical browser in performance.

  * Cycle between loaded pages instantaneously. No split-moment (or longer)
    delay to refresh graphical frame-buffers.
  * Performance merits on both ancient and modern hardware. (I've used on
    Android tablets (within Termux), Arch Linux and Debian laptops, the $5
    Raspberry PI Zero and VPSs)

## howto

Quick Start

Install W3M from any package manager of your respective Linux or Unix-based
distribution. Being such an old and ubiquitous utility, I can't think of any
mainstream distribution that wouldn't offer it.

Download my keymap. While you can remap anything to your liking, throughout
this site I assume you follow my mappings. Some coincide with the defaults,
some modify them, while some merely expand (as W3M allows multiple mappings to
the same operation):

$ cd ~/.w3m
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vparnas/config/master/.w3m/keymap

Start W3M in one of these manners:

$ w3m -v # built-in page
$ w3m -B # bookmark page
$ w3m URL
$ w3m URL URL2 URL3
$ w3m -N URL URL2 URL3  # load each url in a separate tab
$ w3m local file

# Configure home page if w3m started with no arguments
$ export WWW_HOME=URL
$ w3m

Navigation

The keymap enables many vi-compatible strokes, though with deviations, and in
general strives for one-stroke convenience and multiple variations.

Importantly, SPACE, +, =, CTRL-D, DOWN, PAGEDOWN all proceed to the next page.
Likewise, -, CTRL-U, UP, PAGEUP proceed to the previous page.

* I specifically enabled the variety of one-stroke page-by-page shortcuts
(including the counter-intuitive DOWN/UP keys for this purpose) to allow easy,
E-Book reader-like ease of navigation.

TAB and SHIFT+TAB navigate across links and forms.

[ , ] respectively jump to the first and last links.

g, G (in addition to HOME and END) jump to the page top and bottom.

Marks

Though with notable limitations (below), I find the mark system highly
convenient for effective browsing and reading.

I've modified the keystrokes from the default to these much more convenient
one-stroke variants:

m to set/unset a mark, whose cursor position W3M highlights in yellow by
default.

. , (period and comma) to navigate across the existing marks within the page.
Rarely (actually, in no other browser) do I recall this seamless and cyclical
means of mark usage.

See the config section for more related keystrokes.

As for the limitations, first, the marks remain only for the lifetime of the
buffer and the W3M session.

Second, the marks disappear if you resize or reset your terminal, or change the
terminal font. So avoid that ... if you wish to retain those marks.

Searching

The standard, vi-compatible search keys are / ?. Having initiated the search,
use n, N to cycle back and forth.

Additionally, W3M offers the incremental search. Hit CTRL-S, start typing a
search pattern, and the page will instantly transition to the next matching
location. Hit CTRL-S again to repeatedly proceed further through the (so-far)
matchings. CTRL-R works analogously, but backwards.

The incremental search is a handy way to explore the search space without
abandoning your current position until you hit ENTER to land at the currently
highlighted result.

Buffers vs tabs

Buffers

Ultimately, W3M caches all loaded URLs or local files in buffers. The urls you
open via the command line or in the course of navigating, will, by default
stack buffers, one on top of another.

Referring to the keymap, you may navigate back and forth through these buffers
via <, LEFT, >, RIGHT keys.

As you do, the loaded buffers stay in memory, and their access is instantaneous
(contrary to the back/forth operations of a graphical browser, which may need
to reload graphical and/or certain network elements, even if the page is
technically cached.)

To return to the previous buffer and close (unload) the current (this more
inline with a traditional browser), press B.

s displays the buffer selection menu. There you may also choose among the
loaded buffers, or delete/unload with D.

Tabs

W3M also supports tabs, each tab abstracting it's own set of buffers. (I've
long since used tabs, not in W3M, not in any application that supports the
buffer mode of operation, as a tab bar not only takes up extra screen real
estate, but also tends to distract.)

However, for you tabbers out there, the tab navigation keys perform the
expected behavior.

Briefly, CTRL-t, CTRL-w open/close a tab, { } cycle among them, ALT-t opens a
tab menu similar to the buffer menu.

In addition, $ w3m -N URL1 URL2 URL3 on the command line opens all indicated
urls in separate tabs.

Opening URLs, links

U: open a new URL via a dialog.
R: reload the page
Enter: follow the selected link.
t T: follow link in a new tab.
I: When on an image placeholder, download and open the image externally
(typically via xdg-open, which knows how to handle the image).

External programs

Configure up to nine external programs for handling URLS via the following
keystrokes:

O: open current page in an external program.
o (lowercase): open the highlighted link externally.

The above open the page/link via the app in the extbrowser config option, which
opens the url with the default, (usually) graphical browser.

As far as extbrowser2, 3, ..., 9, precede the O/o shortcuts with the
appropriate index. In my config, 7o copies the hovered url to a tmux buffer (if
using tmux). Or 8O would copy the current URL to the X clipboard.

This external program feature is extremely powerful, as it allows you to
interface the url with any graphical or CLI app or pipe.

Saving, downloading

Alt-s: Save the source (html) to disk.
S: Save the rendered buffer (effectively what you see) to disk.
a: Download the source of the highlighted link.
Alt-I: Download the highlighted image.

Viewing the source and buffer editing

v: view document source. The source opens as any other buffer which you may
appropriately handle and manipulate.
E: edit the document source in your external document editor. See the editor
variable in the config.

Buffer editing

One of the more powerful features:

Alt-e: edit the rendered buffer in the external editor.

  * As W3M already renders text, seamlessly edit, strip, manipulate this text
    in your preferred editor (ie Vim, Emacs).
  * Use this as a quick note-taking feature: export sections of the page to a
    yet another external file.
  * Or use the external editor as another means to navigate the page.

Forms, input

Hover over an editable field and press Enter to enter the input line editing
mode (the same mode as when entering a new url) to enter/modify the desired
text.

Alternatively, you may edit the input line via your configured editor with
CTRL-o.

To trigger the submit action (the SUBMIT internal command), either press Enter
over the respective submit button, or CTRL-c over any field belonging to that
form.

Custom commands and macros

The internal COMMAND directive enables you to combine multiple commands.
Easiest is to demonstrate by example. See the handful of macros I've defined.

If you often visit a noisy (cluttered) page, for instance, you could devise a
macro to either directly land you at the desired location (via a search, a
fixed number of links or fields through the page or, a specific line number, if
desperate), or involving the pipe (PIPE_BUF) command, to entirely strip the
page to your desired content (via the Unix grep or similar).

Other features

Alt-a opens the Add Bookmark dialog.
Alt-b opens the bookmark list, split into different categories accessible to
the dialog above.
Alt-r reloads the configuration and keymap if edited during the session.
CTRL-h opens the url history.

Here I've exhibited only the most ubiquitous features you may initially need.
Explore a lot more in the keymap, the W3M help dialog (press H), the config
options, the man page, the command line help ($ w3m -h) for more information
and ideas.

## keymap

The default $HOME/.w3m/keys keystroke configuration I find somewhat suboptimal
for efficient browsing, hence I've modified the keymap for quicker (and
VIM-like) navigation, numerous one-key options in lieu of multiple strokes, as
well as plain ergonomical convenience.

## questions

1) Without JavaScript or the more advanced HTML 5.0, W3M clearly cannot render
much of the modern web. How can it thus serve as a primary browser?

Short answer:

True, but it need not serve as your exclusive browser. With some readaptation
in your browsing habits, it can handle 80% of cases while you appeal to the
ordinary graphical browser for the exceptions. A mere keystroke redirects the
url.

Longer answer

I imagine the following broad tiers of web content:

 1. Simple, predominantly textual pages (ie search engines, Wikipedia, many
    forums and blogs, and arguably the greater portion of the pre-HTML 5.0 web.
    As well as traditional, non-JavaScript form submissions.
 2. Richer, yet still 'strippable' content (non-critical JavaScript, pop-ups,
    limited CMS)
 3. Pages severely or entirely driven via CMS and JavaScript/Ajax (ie
    E-Commerce or Quora, or similarly dynamic pages that gradually load content
    as you navigate)

Tier 1 lends perfectly to a terminal-browser such as W3M.

Tier 2 renders either mostly or partially usable (requiring the graphical
browser for some minority of features)

Tier 3 might either load severely hampered, or not at all.

Ultimately, refer to the short answer avove. Browsing habits aligned with
simplicity, W3M can handle the majority of the important cases.

2) What about the lack of images?

I find this more of benefit than a hindrance.

True, much of the web consists of images. But what portion of all those images
constitute crucial information (or even conductive art), and what portion
strictly noise and bloat?

If your workflow demands consistent graphical throughput (ie image galleries),
or you're a visually oriented web designer, you may be better off in a
graphical browser.

If, however, like myself and many of us, the viewing of that legitimately
critical image falls more along the exceptions, simply hover over the image
placeholder and press the respective key to view that one image in an external
viewer. Or if need be, load the entire page in the 'normie' browser (also via a
single keystroke).
