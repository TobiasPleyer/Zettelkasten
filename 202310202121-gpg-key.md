# GnuPG

A GPG key is meant to be used to encrypt private data, e.g. [[202310202128-email-via-gpg]].

This is all you need since [[202310202132-email-should-be-plaintext]].

## Create a new key

Create a new key with:

```bash
$ gpg --gen-key
```

Alternatively use `gpg --full-gen-key` for a more detailed menu.

## Edit a key's settings

```bash
$ gpg --edit-key <key-id>
```

## Export and import the keys

```bash
$ mkdir ~/exported-keys
$ cd ~/exported-keys
$ gpg --output public.pgp --armor --export tobi.pleyer@gmail.com
$ gpg --output private.pgp --armor --export-secret-key tobi.pleyer@gmail.com
$ scp -r host:exported-keys .
$ gpg --import private.pgp
$ gpg --import public.pgp
```

## Encode/Decode files 

```bash
$ gpg --output doc.gpg --encrypt --recipient blake@cyb.org doc
```

The --recipient option is used once for each recipient and takes an extra argument specifying the public key to which the document should be encrypted. The encrypted document can only be decrypted by someone with a private key that complements one of the recipients' public keys. In particular, you cannot decrypt a document encrypted by you unless you included your own public key in the recipient list.

To decrypt a message the option --decrypt is used. You need the private key to which the message was encrypted. Similar to the encryption process, the document to decrypt is input, and the decrypted result is output.

```bash
$ gpg --output doc --decrypt doc.gpg

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Blake (Executioner) <blake@cyb.org>"
1024-bit ELG-E key, ID 5C8CBD41, created 1999-06-04 (main key ID 9E98BC16)

Enter passphrase: 
```

Documents may also be encrypted without using public-key cryptography. Instead, you use a symmetric cipher to encrypt the document. The key used to drive the symmetric cipher is derived from a passphrase supplied when the document is encrypted, and for good security, it should not be the same passphrase that you use to protect your private key. Symmetric encryption is useful for securing documents when the passphrase does not need to be communicated to others. A document can be encrypted with a symmetric cipher by using the --symmetric option.

```bash
$ gpg --output doc.gpg --symmetric doc
```

The GNU Privacy Guard

GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard as defined
by RFC4880 (also known as PGP). GnuPG allows you to encrypt and sign your data
and communications; it features a versatile key management system, along with
access modules for all kinds of public key directories. GnuPG, also known as
GPG, is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other
applications. A wealth of frontend applications and libraries are available.
GnuPG also provides support for S/MIME and Secure Shell (ssh).

Since its introduction in 1997, GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it
respects your freedom). It can be freely used, modified and distributed under
the terms of the GNU General Public License .

The current version of GnuPG is 2.4.3. See the download page for other
maintained versions.

Gpg4win is a Windows version of GnuPG featuring a context menu tool, a crypto
manager, and an Outlook plugin to send and receive standard PGP/MIME mails. The
current version of Gpg4win is 4.2.0.

Reconquer your privacy

    Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have
    nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about free
    speech because you have nothing to say. â€“ Edward Snowden

Using encryption helps to protect your privacy and the privacy of the people
you communicate with. Encryption makes life difficult for bulk surveillance
systems. GnuPG is one of the tools that Snowden used to uncover the secrets of
the NSA.

to learn how and why you should use GnuPG for your electronic communication.
