# Alternate screen for terminals

You type `man bash`, the man pager opens (less - most likely) you read, you
close the pager and you are back where you left off. How?

Most modern terminals support the concept of the **alternate screen** - another
terminal buffer independent of the main buffer. The alternate typically has no
scrollback and is meant for fullscreen applications.

Entering the alternate buffer can be done via terminal control sequence:

```
tput smcup
```

Leaving it via:

```
tput rmcup
```
