# Have a pomodoro timer running in one of your tabs

This is my first take on this. As of now I use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as my terminal. Kitty supports
the terminal control sequence to set a title: `echo -ne "\033]0;the title\007"`.

Steps:
- Open a terminal
- Start the pomodoro timer
- Open another window in the tab
- Execute the update script

As a pomodoro timer a found [pomo](https://github.com/kevinschoon/pomo) to be quite nice. The nice thing: *pomo* can
inform about its status via `pomo status`. Thus we can write a simple while loop in the shell to have our timmer tick
in the tab:

```zsh
while true; do echo -ne "\033]0;$(pomo status)\007"; sleep 1; done
```
