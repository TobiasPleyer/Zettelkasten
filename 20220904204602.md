# The `UNIX` editor blood line

> qed -> ed -> ex/vi -> vim

`qed` and `ex` are strictly line based editors. `ex` came as an improvement of
`ed`, but in addition also with a **visual mode**, that being `vi`. This is
important to realize: **vi and ex are the same thing, the same binary**. They
are just different editing modes and you can actually switch between them. When
in **ex mode** you can type `:vi(sual)` to switch to vi, i.e. **visual mode**
and when in vi(m) you enter **ex mode** via `gQ`.

There are also `nvi` and `nex`, which are the standard implementations of
`vi/ex` for the **BSD** system.
