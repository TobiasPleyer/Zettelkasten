# Local Email

Email is omnipresent in our everyday life. For most things using browser mail
clients like GMail is enough, but it is always best to stay in control of your
own data.

If you synchronize your mail to a local machine in your network you can:

  - Create your own backups or backup strategy
  - Perform custom filtering, searching and spam detection
  - Work offline
  - Work faster and with no network delays

## Components involved in mail sending/delivery

1. An SMTP server that receives and sends emails on your behalf and an IMAP
   server which allows you to access your emails
2. Secure authentication with the server, without needing to type your password
   all the time or to store it unencrypted
3. A way to fetch emails from the IMAP server
4. A “mail user agent” (MUA), that can read the maildir format and compose
   emails 
5. A way to send emails to the SMTP server for deliver
6. Optionally: a search engine
7. Optionally: an address book

### Possible choices:

1. Dovecot, GMail, Outlook, etc.
2. [[202310202121-gpg-key|GPG]], [[202310202113-Pass - The standard UNIX password manager|passwordstore (pass)]],

3. isync (mbsync), offlineimap
4. aerc, meli, mutt, [[20220828073428|neomutt]], alot
5. msmtp, msmtpq
6. notmuch
7. abook, maildir-rank-addr, khard
