# Bind `fzf` action to add a zettel reference in the current open zettel

## Background knowledge

### Neovim

Neovim allows to be controlled remotely via **RPC** (`:h clientserver`, `:h api-rpc`). There is a command line utility
to make use of that: [nvr](https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote).

### fzf

I use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) as my command line fuzzy-finder. With *fzf* you can bind keystrokes to
actions. Interesting for us: **execute-silent**.

## Idea

Bind a *nvr* action to a key combination in *fzf* which will cause the current zettel to be added at the end of the
file as a **Folgezettel**.

## Solution

Add `--bind "ctrl-a:execute-silent(nvr --remote-send 'Go[[{1}]]<esc>')"` to the call to *fzf*.

**Disclaimer:** I use this with the search function of [neuron](https://github.com/srid/neuron).

It requires an open nvim session with an open socket/port to receive **RPC** requests.
