# Libtool and pkg-config

These are competing tools that address the same problem: Cross-platform build support for static and shared libraries.
They hide the details of the different platforms from the user and provide a unified interface.

Libtool is used by Autoconf and Automake, two other portability tools in the GNU build system, but can also be used
directly.
