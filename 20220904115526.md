# Why `ed` matters

The `ed` command line tool is a **line editor**, i.e. it does not require a full `curses` capable terminal or such to
do its job. It works strictly line based without the need of a `pty`.

This can prove very useful to a hacker, which often won't have a full terminal session available but only a `CLI` based
backdoor. Also: With `ed` there's almost no logging going on.
