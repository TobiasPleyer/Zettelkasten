# The runtime path of an ELF executable

`ELF` executables can have a hardcoded path compiled into them which describes where to look for libraries that need to
be loaded at runtime. This is called the **runtime path**, or **rpath** for short.

This feature is heavily used by [[20220915081219.md]] to capsulate its build artifacts.

One possible way to inspect the `rpath` is to use `readelf`:

```bash
readelf -d <path to binary or lib> | rg -i runpath
```
