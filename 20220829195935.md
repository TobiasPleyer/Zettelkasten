# The evolution of the terminal

1. You had to manually switch the computer's relais
1. Punch cards were developed to automate this process
1. Characters were typed in in morse code (ticker tape)
1. The teletype (typewriter with digital output) was developed to automate the
   character encoding. The teletype echoed the typed text on paper just like a
   typewriter.
