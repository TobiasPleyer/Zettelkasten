# How `Nix` makes libraries available to the build process.

The default builder to used by `Nix` is the *generic* builder. The generic builder assumes a standard `UNIX` build
based on [automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/index.html). To make the `Nix` dependencies
available mainly two things happen:

- All binaries are added to the `PATH` (`$out/bin`)
- All library locations need to be disclosed to the build process

How is the latter achieved?

## Libtool

This is done in the **configurePhase** of the generic builder:

```bash
fixLibtool() {
    local search_path
    for flag in $NIX_LDFLAGS; do
        case $flag in
            -L*)
                search_path+=" ${flag#-L}"
                ;;
        esac
    done

    sed -i "$1" \
        -e "s^eval \(sys_lib_search_path=\).*^\1'$search_path'^" \
        -e 's^eval sys_lib_.+search_path=.*^^'
}

configurePhase() {
# ... skipped lines
        find . -iname "ltmain.sh" -print0 | while IFS='' read -r -d '' i; do
            echo "fixing libtool script $i"
            fixLibtool "$i"
        done
# ... skipped lines
}
```

That means `Nix` manipulates the managment script of [libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/) so that the
library dependencies are found during the *configure* phase of the *automake* suite.

## pkg-config

In case of [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) this can be controlled via the
environment variable `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, which is populated by `Nix` with all the locations of build dependencies.

The pkg-config manipulation is handled by `<nixpkgs>/pkgs/build-support/pkg-config-wrapper`.
