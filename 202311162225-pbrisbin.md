Most people use Gmail. Some people like CLI mail clients. This post describes
how I use Gmail in the best CLI mail client, mutt. Many people will back me up
when I say it’s a very good setup.

For reference, my complete and current setup can be found with my dotfiles.

Offlineimap 🔗

Step one is to setup Offlineimap to keep ~/Mail in sync with Gmail. This is a
two way sync so anything moved, deleted, or sent from any IMAP-connected device
or our local mutt interface will act exactly the same. This also has the
benefit of storing offline, local copies of all your mails.

First, install Offlineimap and fill in an ~/.offlineimaprc like so:

[general]
ui = ttyui
accounts = Gmail

[Account Gmail]
localrepository = Gmail-Local
remoterepository = Gmail-Remote

[Repository Gmail-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Mail/Gmail

[Repository Gmail-Remote]
type = Gmail
remoteuser = you@gmail.com
remotepass = secret
realdelete = no
maxconnections = 3
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

Test that this works by running offlineimap -o. Your first sync could take some
time, but once done, you should see the folders under ~/Mail/Gmail with the
proper structure.

Once you’re satisfied syncing is working, we’ll schedule a periodic sync via
cron.

There are some tempting options offlineimap has for daemonizing itself to
handle periodic syncing for you – in my experience these don’t work. Scheduling
a full offlineimap run via cron is the only working setup I’ve been able to
find.

To work around a thread-joining bug, I’ve landed on a wrapper script that
spawns offlineimap to the background then babysits the process for up to 60
seconds. If it appears to be hung, it’s killed.

#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check every ten seconds if the process identified as $1 is still 
# running. After 5 checks (~60 seconds), kill it. Return non-zero to 
# indicate something was killed.
monitor() {
  local pid=$1 i=0

  while ps $pid &>/dev/null; do
    if (( i++ > 5 )); then
      echo "Max checks reached. Sending SIGKILL to ${pid}..." >&2
      kill -9 $pid; return 1
    fi

    sleep 10
  done

  return 0
}

read -r pid < ~/.offlineimap/pid

if ps $pid &>/dev/null; then
  echo "Process $pid already running. Exiting..." >&2
  exit 1
fi

offlineimap -o -u quiet & monitor $!

Set this script to run as frequently as you want, by adding something like the
following to your crontab – I chose to sync once every 3 minutes:

*/3 * * * * /path/to/mailrun.sh

Msmtp 🔗

Now we need a way to send mails. I like msmtp, you can also use other smtp
clients. If you choose to install msmtp, the config file is at ~/.msmtprc and
should look like this:

account default
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
protocol smtp
auth on
from user@gmail.com
user user@gmail.com
password secret
tls on
tls_nocertcheck

You can test this by executing echo "a test message" | msmtp you@gmail.com.

Mutt 🔗

Now the fun part! I don’t know how many hours I’ve spent in the past year fine
tuning my muttrc, but it’ll never be done. Here are the parts required to get
this setup working.

set mbox_type   = Maildir
set sendmail    = /usr/bin/msmtp

set folder      = ~/Mail
set spoolfile   = "+INBOX"
set mbox        = "+[Gmail]/All Mail"
set postponed   = "+[Gmail]/Drafts"
unset record

mailboxes +INBOX

macro index D \
    "<save-message>+[Gmail]/Trash<enter>" \
    "move message to the trash"

macro index S \
    "<save-message>+[Gmail]/Spam<enter>" \
    "mark message as spam"

The above should be enough to get a connection and start sending/receiving
mail, but here are some other must-have options that make it feel a bit more
like gmail:

# main options
set realname   = "Real Name"
set from       = "user@gmail.com"
set mail_check = 0
set envelope_from

unset move           # gmail does that
set delete           # don't ask, just do
unset confirmappend  # don't ask, just do!
set quit             # don't ask, just do!!
unset mark_old       # read/new is good enough for me

# sort/threading
set sort     = threads
set sort_aux = reverse-last-date-received
set sort_re

# look and feel
set pager_index_lines = 8
set pager_context     = 5
set pager_stop
set menu_scroll
set smart_wrap
set tilde
unset markers

# composing
set fcc_attach
unset mime_forward
set forward_format = "Fwd: %s"
set include
set forward_quote

ignore *                               # first, ignore all headers
unignore from: to: cc: date: subject:  # then, show only these
hdr_order from: to: cc: date: subject: # and in this order

I’ve left out quite a few tweaks in the above so that those who are happy with
mutt’s very sane defaults aren’t overwhelmed. Keep in mind, man muttrc is a
great command for when you’re bored.

That should do it. Hopefully this info will get you going in the right
direction.

Using Two IMAP Accounts in Mutt

Dec 5, 2009 00:00 · 639 words · 3 minute read

Mutt can be really great with multiple accounts, but it’s not exactly intuitive
to setup. Here I’ll document how I access two Gmail accounts together in one
mutt instance.

If you haven’t yet seen my previous mutt post, please go read [that][] now. I
recommend using that post to get a single account setup first before coming
back here. Even if you plan to jump right into a multi-account setup, this post
assumes you’ve at least read the other one and will focus on the differences
and required changes to get from there to here.

Offlineimap 🔗

To get Offlineimap syncing multiple accounts, we simply need to add additional
configuration blocks to sync the second account with another local Maildir.

~/.offlineimaprc

[general]
ui = ttyui
accounts = Personal,Work

[Account Personal]
localrepository = Personal-Local
remoterepository = Personal-Remote

[Account Work]
localrepository = Work-Local
remoterepository = Work-Remote

[Repository Personal-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Mail/Personal

[Repository Work-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/Mail/Work

[Repository Personal-Remote]
type = Gmail
remoteuser = username@gmail.com
remotepass = secret
realdelete = no
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

[Repository Work-Remote]
type = Gmail
remoteuser = work-username@gmail.com
remotepass = secret
realdelete = no
sslcacertfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

Obviously, if either of these accounts weren’t a Gmail server, the
configuration blocks would be different.

You can test your setup by running offlineimap -o to sync things once. It could
take a while, but once done, you should have a nice folder structure like this:

Mail/
|-- Personal
|   |-- INBOX
|   `-- ...
`-- Work
    |-- INBOX
    `-- ...

Msmtp 🔗

Msmtp also handles multiple accounts very elegantly, we just add another
account block for the second account.

~/.msmtprc

# shared defaults since both are gmail accounts
defaults
host smtp.gmail.com
port 587
protocol smtp
auth on
tls on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

account personal
from username@gmail.com
user username@gmail.com
password secret

account work
from work-username@gmail.com
user work-username@gmail.com
password secret

account default : personal

Now we can simply call msmtp -a personal or msmtp -a work to use whichever
account we want. Omitting the -a option will use the default account which
we’ve set as personal.

Mutt 🔗

The goal with mutt is to have certain settings change when we enter certain
folders. For example, when we’re viewing +Personal/INBOX we want our from
setting to be our personal From address and the sendmail setting should be
msmtp -a personal. To provide this functionality, we’re going to do the
following:

 1. Place any account-specific settings in separate files
 2. Use mutt’s folder-hook facility to source the proper file and set the
    proper settings upon entering a folder for a given account.

Here are the two account-specific files:

~/.mutt/accounts/personal

set from      = "username@gmail.com"
set sendmail  = "/usr/bin/msmtp -a personal"
set mbox      = "+Personal/archive"
set postponed = "+Personal/drafts"

color status green default

macro index D \
    "<save-message>+Personal/Trash<enter>" \
    "move message to the trash"

macro index S \
    "<save-message>+Personal/Spam<enter>"  \
        "mark message as spam"

~/.mutt/accounts/work

set from      = "work-username@gmail.com"
set sendmail  = "/usr/bin/msmtp -a work"
set mbox      = "+Work/archive"
set postponed = "+Work/drafts"

color status cyan default

macro index D \
    "<save-message>+Work/Trash<enter>" \
    "move message to the trash"

macro index S \
    "<save-message>+Work/Spam<enter>"  \
        "mark message as spam"

Notice the color line which changes the status bar depending on what account
I’m “in” at any given moment.

The following settings will tell mutt to source one of these files upon
entering a folder matching the given pattern, this will setup all the correct
settings when entering a folder for a given account:

~/.muttrc

set spoolfile = "+Personal/INBOX"

source ~/.mutt/personal

folder-hook Personal/* source ~/.mutt/accounts/personal
folder-hook Work/*     source ~/.mutt/accounts/work

The first two lines effectively set Personal as the default account when we
open mutt.

Well, that should do it. Open up mutt, change folders, send some mails, and
make sure everything’s working as you’d expect.

For reference, my complete and current setup can be found with my dotfiles.
