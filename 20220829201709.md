# CLI is not the same as terminal

A CLI - C(ommand) L(ine) (I)nterface - reads a line, evaluates it, returns an
answer and then asks for the next line. This is also known as REPL - R(ead)
E(valuate) P(rint) L(oop).

A terminal gives you a cell based matrix to display text. The terminal itself
does not read and evaluate line instructions. It displays characters on its
surface and can receive control sequences which can manipulate what is
displayed on the cell matrix.

If a hacker establishes a backdoor into a system all he gets is a CLI, not a
terminal. He can then undermine the target system one command at a time.
